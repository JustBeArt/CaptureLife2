              <br>
              <br>I'm a photographer based in London, Great Britain.
              <br>
              <br>But much more than that, I consider myself a traveler, an earth child, a cat cuddler, a happy and social introvert, a tea drinker, a big hearted, open minded and in some way spiritual weirdo.
              <br>
              <br>I believe in authenticity, imperfection and forgiveness, love and courage, passion and yearning and have a weakness for people who follow their own path away from what others think they should do.

         A FEW THOUGHTS ON PHOTOGRAPHY...
         <br>With advances in digital technology, we have as photographers endless opportunity to enhance our art. Some imagery these days is incredibly beautiful but might seem misleading. You might be inclined to think a beach is empty when in reality 100 tourists have been plucked out of the photo in post-processing.
         <br>
         <br>Colours are created and enhanced. Does this bother or inspire you? Neither?
         <br>I think as photographers we don't just capture, but create. It's part of our job description to manipulate imagery using creative cropping and angles in camera, and then many take it a step further during the editing process. There are some incredible artists out there who use extreme post-processing skills to enhance their vision - the results are pretty incredible. It's their vision and they've used tools to execute it.
         <br>
         <br>Would you rather see an image as it was - colours, surrounding scene, passers by, or a finished version that leaves you amazed ?
         <br>
         <br>I take my camera everywhere with me, thanks to that I can capture situations which I’m exposed to, people who I meet and moments which I experience.
         <br>The beauty of everyday life and moments which aren’t anticipated. Life is all around us.
