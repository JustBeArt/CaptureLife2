# Capture Life Project
The Capture Life website is a project that was done as part of the Apr-June 2019
CodeFirstGirls Professionals Web Development Course.
This was a collaboration between Justyna Borczynska, Hanna Aikas and Justine Livingstone.

The aim was to create a beautiful and functional website that showcases Justyna's photography.
We intentionally kept the Homepage and Portfolio page minimalistic, to let the pictures speak for themselves.
For those hungry for more written information, this is contained in the Contacts/About page.

The website includes features such as:
- Burger menu to navigate across the 3 pages
- Photo carousel on Homepage
- Modal images on Portfolio page - if you click on the images, they pop up with a text telling you about the photo
- Social media buttons on bottom of Homepage and Contacts/About pages

We used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery to deliver this project.
We worked remotely, communicating via Slack, and handling version control via our own branches on GitHub.

The project folder contains the HTML docs for the pages, and 2 separate CSS files.
We wanted different styling for the Portfolio page, hence it has its own CSS file.
The folder also contains the images (i.e. photographs).
The logo on the Contacts/About page is via an Imgur link.
